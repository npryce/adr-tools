usage: adr new [-n NUMBER] [-s SUPERCEDED] [-l TARGET:LINK:REVERSE-LINK] TITLE_TEXT...

Creates a new, numbered ADR.  The TITLE_TEXT arguments are concatenated to
form the title of the new ADR.  The ADR is opened for editing in the
editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable (VISUAL is
preferred; EDITOR is used if VISUAL is not set).  After editing, the
file name of the ADR is output to stdout, so the command can be used in
scripts.

If the ADR directory contains a file `templates/template.md`, this is used as
the template for the new ADR.  Otherwise the following file is used:

  ${adr_template_dir}/template.md

This template follows the style described by Michael Nygard in this article.

Options:

-n NUMBER       Create the new ADR with a given number.

-s SUPERCEDED   A reference (number or partial filename) of a previous
                decision that the new decision supercedes. A Markdown link
                to the superceded ADR is inserted into the Status section.
                The status of the superceded ADR is changed to record that
                it has been superceded by the new ADR.

-l TARGET:LINK:REVERSE-LINK
                Links the new ADR to a previous ADR.
                TARGET is a reference (number or partial filename) of a
                previous decision.
                LINK is the description of the link created in the new ADR.
                REVERSE-LINK is the description of the link created in the
                existing ADR that will refer to the new ADR.

Multiple -s and -l options can be given, so that the new ADR can supercede
or link to multiple existing ADRs.

E.g. to create a new ADR with the title "Use MySQL Database":

    adr new Use MySQL Database

E.g. to create a new ADR that supercedes ADR 12:

    adr new -s 12 Use PostgreSQL Database

E.g. to create a new ADR that supercedes ADRs 3 and 4, and amends ADR 5:

    adr new -s 3 -s 4 -l "5:Amends:Amended by" Use Riak CRDTs to cope with scale
