# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 12/02/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
We accept the drawbacks that
(i) it is not enforced that a justification is stated and
(ii) it is not enforced that considered other options are listed.
In other templates such as the [Y-Statements](https://www.infoq.com/articles/sustainable-architectural-design-decisions) or [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/), these drawbacks are not present.
